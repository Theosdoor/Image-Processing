## Overview
Prepare the X-Ray Image Processing project for GitHub portfolio.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Clean Up Repository
- [ ] Remove or move coursework-specific files (PDF report)
- [ ] Review .gitignore for sensitive/unnecessary files
- [ ] Remove "[INPUT COURSEWORK RESULTS]" placeholder from README
- [ ] Check for any student ID references or personal information
- [ ] Verify Results/ folder is properly gitignored (generated outputs)

### 2. Update README.md
- [ ] Rewrite title and introduction to be portfolio-focused
- [ ] Add a strong project description highlighting technical skills
- [ ] Add a "Features" or "Key Highlights" section
- [ ] Include screenshots or example results (before/after images)
- [ ] Add information about the Criminisi algorithm implementation
- [ ] Improve the structure and readability
- [ ] Add badges (if applicable - Python version, license, etc.)
- [ ] Add a "Technologies Used" section
- [ ] Consider adding a "Challenges & Solutions" or "What I Learned" section
- [ ] Add contact/portfolio links (optional)

### 3. Code Quality
- [ ] Review code for clarity and documentation
- [ ] Add/improve docstrings in main files
- [ ] Check for consistent code style
- [ ] Add comments for complex algorithms
- [ ] Rename nb_main.py to main.py if appropriate

### 4. Project Structure
- [ ] Consider adding example output images to showcase results
- [ ] Create an examples/ or demo/ folder with sample outputs
- [ ] Ensure all necessary files are included and documented

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Add a LICENSE file (MIT, Apache 2.0, or appropriate license)
- [ ] Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md if accepting contributions
- [ ] Add technical details about the Criminisi algorithm implementation
- [ ] Document any modifications or improvements to the original algorithm

### 6. Dependencies & Setup
- [ ] Verify requirements.txt is complete and minimal
- [ ] Consider migrating to pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
- [ ] Test installation process on fresh environment
- [ ] Add Python version compatibility information

### 7. Final Polish
- [ ] Proofread all documentation
- [ ] Check for consistent markdown formatting
- [ ] Test all code examples in README
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Add a project description for GitHub's "About" section

## Notes
- Project received 67% (2:1) - avoid highlighting grade, focus on technical implementation
- Emphasize: Criminisi algorithm implementation, image processing skills, OpenCV usage, practical application
- This showcases: Computer vision, algorithm implementation, Python proficiency, medical imaging application
